/*EASY: Write a function that would allow you to do this:

var run = exercise('running');

console.log(run()); // prints "Today's exercise: running"

var swim = exercise('swimming');

console.log(swim()); // prints "Today's exercise: swimming"*/


/*let run = exercise('running');

let swim = exercise2('swimming');

function exercise2 () {
